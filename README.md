# Rustikal WordPress Theme (WiP üõ†)

Rustikal (German for rustic, as in "made in a plain and simple fashion.") is a fairly simple WordPress theme that aims to enable **fast deployment** of **simple client websites** on **low-cost hosters**.

### Motivation

As someone who originally came from WordPress theme development and then became a full-time React/Next.JS developer, I was looking for a simple way to build websites without  <s>getStaticProps</s> bloat‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

This theme should feel like coming home without having to give up all the good things you've come to know and love over the years working with fancier technologies. I think the cool guys call it ‚Äúbattery included".

TODOs:

- [x] Embed status quo into underscores (https://underscores.me/)
- [ ] Consider including sharp image optimization (https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)
